# editions_srt
SRT Publishing is a series of editions whose layout is done in a standalone way, entirely managed by the code. It is made from SRT files, used to synchronize movie subtitles, where each replica is timed to the nearest hundredth of a second. The spaces vary according to the time without words, and the body of the typography depends on the length that the replicas occupy in the film.
